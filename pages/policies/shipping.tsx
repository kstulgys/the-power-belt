      We work with suppliers around the world to source high quality products. Our suppliers typically ship items one to five days of receiving an order. From
      that point, it takes 7 - 14 days for items to arrive. As soon as your product ships, you'll receive a tracking number that will let you keep tabs of where
      your order is at all times
